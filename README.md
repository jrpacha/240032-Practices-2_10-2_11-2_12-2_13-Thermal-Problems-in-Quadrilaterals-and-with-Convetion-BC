The guides that explain these practices are available at prof. Antonio Sus√≠n's [Numerical Factory: FEM -- Practices](https://numfactory.upc.edu/numfactory/subjects/?subject=FEM&version=etseib&lang=en&section=2&subsection=P)

The required extra and mesh files are in two zipped folders that can be downloaded from the same web page (click the links you will find at the bottom). We also give the links here:

* [addtionalFiles.zip](https://numfactory.upc.edu/web/FiniteElements/files/additionalFiles.zip)
* [meshFilesAll.zip](https://numfactory.upc.edu/numfactory/subjects/FEM/Extra/meshFilesAll.zip)

## Extra and plot files required

* `linearTriangElment.m`
* `applyConvTriang.m`
* `baryCoord.m`  
* `gaussValues1D.m`
* `gaussValues2DQuad.m`
* `bilinearQuadElement.m`
* `applyConvQuad.m`
* `baryCoordQuad.m`
* `plotElements.m`
* `plotElementsOld.m`
* `plotCountourSolution.m`

Uncompress the zipped folder: [addtionalFiles.zip](https://numfactory.upc.edu/web/FiniteElements/files/additionalFiles.zip) and place these files in in the same directory that the scripts which call the corresponding functions. 

Additionally, the following mesh files are required as well:

* `mesh2x2Quad.m`
* `mesh4x4Quad.m`
* `mesh8x8Quad.m`
* `meshmeshPlacaForatQuad.m`
* `meshAleta2DQuad.m`
* `meshAleta2DTriang.m`

Uncompress the zipped folder: [addtionalFiles.zip](https://numfactory.upc.edu/numfactory/subjects/FEM/Extra/meshFilesAll.zip) and place these files in in the same directory that the scripts which load the corresponding mesh files.
